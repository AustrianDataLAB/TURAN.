# ADR 0002 - Versioning

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Define a versioning scheme for the turandot project.

## Decision

Versioning should adhere to Semantic Versioning as defined in https://semver.org/.

As API in the sense of Semantic Versioning we thereby define the set of configurational paramters available for deployment of the product

- Major versions shall be increased if there are backwords compatibility breaking changes to such parameters.
- Minor versions shall be increased for new functionality added without breaking compatiblity.
- Patch level shall be increased with every bugfix, vulnerability mitigation etc.

The alternative considered was Calendar Versioning (https://calver.org), which we did not choose.

## Consequences
Every new release has to be checked against the above criteria including the criteria pointed out at https://semver.org/ and the version number has to be set properly.
