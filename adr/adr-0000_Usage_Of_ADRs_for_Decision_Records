# ADR 0000 - Usage of ADRs for Decision Records

## Status

Accepted (4/0)

## Context

For the recording of decisions we should have a way of recording our decisionmaking. We should also be able to remember our decisionmaking in the future.

## Decision

The following options were considered:
- Using ADRs
- Not using ADRs

In the end we chose Option 1 ("Using ADRs").

## Consequences

Decisions in the future will now be documented using the ADR template. Other team members also need to be informed on how ADRs are going to be used and written. We also need to make sure that ADRs are used and written throughout the project
